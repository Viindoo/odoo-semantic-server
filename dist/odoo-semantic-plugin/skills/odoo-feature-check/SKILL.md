description: >
  Answer the question "does standard Odoo already do this?" with evidence — module name,
  edition (CE / Odoo EE / Viindoo EE), key fields/models, and a one-line verdict ready for
  a client email. Use this skill ANY time someone is checking ONE feature's availability,
  even if they phrase it as a yes/no question or with no technical vocabulary at all. Pushy
  trigger: if the user asks "does Odoo have…", "is X available out of the box?", "do we
  need to build this or is it already there?", "tính năng X có sẵn không?", "Odoo CE có
  module Y không?", "what edition do I need for Z?" — fire this skill before answering
  from memory, because training data about Odoo modules drifts fast. Realistic phrases:
  "does Odoo 17 have subscription billing built-in?", "Odoo có sẵn module quản lý tài sản
  cố định không?", "is there a standard timesheet approval workflow?", "client asked if
  Odoo handles SEPA direct debit out of the box", "khách hỏi có sẵn báo cáo VAS không?",
  "do we need EE for accounting localization?", "tính năng X có cần custom không?",
  "module Y có trong CE không?", "what's the standard way Odoo does X?". Use this when
  the user is asking about ONE feature/module; when they list MANY requirements at once
  route to odoo-gap-analysis instead. When they want to see real source-code examples of
  X being used, route to odoo-feature-highlights or odoo-capability-proof.

## Persona
Consultant / Developer

## MCP tools
At session start: `set_active_version(odoo_version='17.0')` so subsequent calls inherit
the version.

Primary tools:
- `check_module_exists(module, …)` — first-line signal: does the module exist in this
  version at all?
- `module_inspect(module, method='describe')` — full architecture overview when the module
  exists (manifest summary, model count, view count, JS patch count).
- `module_inspect(module, method='fields' | 'views')` — drill into what the module actually
  declares, when a yes/no answer isn't enough.
- `model_inspect(model, method='all')` — full schema of the primary model in one call.
- `find_examples(query)` — real-world usage of similar features, useful when the module
  exists but you want concrete evidence of coverage.
- `suggest_pattern(query)` — canonical pattern when partial coverage means an Extension is
  needed.

For bookmark-stable evidence to paste into proposals/emails:
`odoo://17.0/module/account_asset` gives the module's full architecture as a stable URI.

## Context

Standard Odoo coverage exists at four levels:
1. **CE native** — free, zero customization needed
2. **Odoo EE only** — requires paid Odoo Enterprise subscription
3. **Viindoo EE** — available via Viindoo Enterprise, may overlap with Odoo EE
4. **Community App Store** — third-party OCA or Viindoo modules (note: not officially supported)

Version matters — a feature in v17 may not exist in v12. Always ask or infer the target version.

For v8/v9 (OpenERP era): module names and features differ significantly. The `sale` module in v8
has a very different field set than v16. When checking features for legacy versions, note that
many "new" features in v12+ didn't exist at all in v8/v9.

Viindoo note: Viindoo modules prefixed `viin_` cover many Vietnamese-specific requirements
(VAS accounting, Vietnamese tax, HR Vietnamese labor law) that neither CE nor Odoo EE provide.

**Data priority:** When `check_module_exists` result conflicts with training knowledge about
whether a feature exists, trust the MCP result. MCP reflects the indexed codebase; training
data about specific Odoo module names and versions is frequently outdated.

## Instructions

**Round 0 — Pin the version (once):** `set_active_version(odoo_version=…)`.

**Round 1 — Parallel:** Call `check_module_exists` + `find_examples` simultaneously.
`find_examples` takes a semantic query from the requirement text and does not need the
module check result. Both are independent — fire together.

**Round 2 — Parallel (after Round 1):** Call `model_inspect(model=…, method='all')` (needs
module/model name from Round 1) + `suggest_pattern` simultaneously. `suggest_pattern` can
be formulated from the requirement even if Round 1 shows partial coverage — they are
independent of each other.

**Round 3 — Deep dive (when `check_module_exists` confirms presence):** Call
`module_inspect(module=<name>, method='describe')` to surface the module's full
architecture: manifest summary, which models it defines vs extends, view count, and JS patch
count. This gives the consultant a confident, evidence-backed answer about what the module
actually covers — beyond the bare "exists / does not exist" signal. If the module is confirmed
to exist, also consider drilling into specifics with `module_inspect(method='fields')` or
`module_inspect(method='views')` in a subsequent call if the client asks about exact field
or view coverage.

**Verdict levels:**
- `Available in CE` — standard, zero cost
- `Available in Odoo EE only` — requires Enterprise subscription
- `Available in Viindoo EE` — available via Viindoo commercial
- `Partial — standard covers X, custom needed for Y` — specify the gap precisely
- `Not available — custom development required` — honest assessment with effort note

Always cite the exact module name so clients can verify independently.

## Output format

```
## Feature Availability Check

**Feature requested:** <feature description>
**Odoo version:** <version>

| Feature aspect | CE | Odoo EE | Viindoo EE | Module | Notes |
|---------------|:--:|:-------:|:----------:|--------|-------|
| ...           | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ | ...  | ...   |

### Verdict
**<Available in CE / Available in EE only / Available in Viindoo EE / Partial / Not available>**

### Evidence
- **Module:** `<module_name>`
- **Primary model:** `<model_name>`
- **Module scope:** <N> models defined, <N> models extended, <N> views, <N> JS patches (from module_inspect describe)
- **Key fields:** `<field1>`, `<field2>` — <what they implement>
- **Example:** <brief description from find_examples>

### Custom development needed (if partial)
- **Gap:** <what standard doesn't cover>
- **Extension pattern:** <from suggest_pattern>
- **Estimated effort:** <S/M/L>

### Recommendation
<1–2 sentences for the client>
```

## Examples

**Example 1:**
Prompt: "does Odoo have a subscription billing module built in?"
Output: Feature table showing `sale_subscription` exists in EE only (not CE), key model
`sale.order` with `subscription_id` field, verdict "Available in Odoo EE only", plus note that
Viindoo has `viin_sale_subscription` covering similar needs.

**Example 2:**
Prompt: "Odoo 17 có sẵn module quản lý tài sản cố định không?"
Output: `account_asset` exists in EE, not CE. Viindoo EE has `viin_account_asset`.
`model_inspect(model='account.asset', method='all')` shows key fields. Recommendation in
Vietnamese context.
