description: >
  Systematic audit of deprecated Odoo API usage in a codebase before a version upgrade —
  finds every `@api.multi`, `osv.osv`, `_columns`, `web.Widget`, `fields.Html` and other
  era-specific APIs that will break or warn in the target version, grouped by file with the
  exact replacement and urgency level (BREAKING / WARN / STYLE). Use this skill ANY time
  someone is preparing for, considering, or planning an Odoo version migration — even
  informally. Pushy trigger: fire whenever the conversation touches "upgrade", "migration",
  "nâng cấp", "is our code ready for v17?", "what will break when we move from 14 to 17?",
  "chuẩn bị migrate", "audit before upgrade", "code cũ trước khi nâng cấp", "upgrade
  readiness check", "khách định nâng lên Odoo 17 — bao nhiêu module cần sửa?", "we still
  have @api.multi everywhere", "ir.values is still used in our addons", "tìm code OpenERP
  còn sót lại trong repo", "OWL migration needed?", "from v12 to v16 — what's the breaking
  list?", "client running v8 wants to upgrade to v17 — feasible?". Trigger even when the user
  doesn't use the word "deprecation" — if the goal is "before upgrade", that's this skill's
  job. When the user asks ONLY what changed between two versions (without auditing their
  code), route to odoo-version-diff instead. When they want to write fresh upgrade-safe
  code in the target version, route to odoo-coder.

## Persona
Developer / Tech Lead

## MCP tools
At session start: `set_active_version(odoo_version=<source_version>)` so subsequent calls
inherit the source version of the codebase being audited (the migration TARGET version is
passed explicitly to `api_version_diff`).

Primary tools:
- `find_deprecated_usage(pattern, …)` — scans the indexed codebase for usages of a deprecated
  symbol.
- `api_version_diff(symbol, from_version, to_version)` — version-to-version delta for a core
  API (e.g. `fields.Char` signature changes).
- `lookup_core_api(symbol)` — confirm whether a symbol still exists in the target version and
  what replaced it if not.
- `entity_lookup(kind='method', model=…, method=…)` — drill into a specific method's
  signature changes across versions.
- `module_inspect(module, method='patches')` — enumerate `web.Widget`-era JS patches that
  need OWL rewrites.

## Context

Odoo deprecation happens in layers:
- **Deprecated** — still works, emits a warning, will be removed in N+1 or N+2
- **Removed** — will throw `AttributeError` or `ImportError` in the target version
- **Changed signature** — same name, different parameters; silent breakage

**Era-specific knowledge:**
- **v8/v9 (OpenERP era)**: `osv.osv`, `orm.TransientModel`, `_columns` dict, `fields.function`,
  `_constraints`, `cr.execute` without context manager, `pool.get()`. Migrating from v8/v9
  requires rewriting models entirely — effort is significantly higher.
- **v10–v12**: `@api.multi`, `@api.one`, `self.env.cr`, old `ir.values`. The `@api.multi`/
  `@api.one` decorators were removed in v13. This is a major breaking point.
- **v13**: OWL introduced as new JS framework alongside old `web.Widget` — NOT yet the primary
  framework. Most views still use the legacy widget system in v13.
- **v14**: OWL becomes the primary frontend framework. `web.Widget` deprecated (still present).
- **v15**: OWL 2.0 migration. Many JS `AbstractModel`, `AbstractRenderer` patterns removed.
- **v16**: `web.Widget` removed completely.
- **v16+**: `fields.Char(string=...)` positional arg removed; `Html` → `HtmlField`; old
  `_inherits` patterns deprecated. Python 3.10+ required.
- **v17+**: `float_round` deprecation, `tools.config` partial changes, OWL 2.x stable.

**Data priority:** MCP tool results are ground truth. If `find_deprecated_usage` or
`api_version_diff` returns a symbol that training knowledge says is still valid, trust the
MCP result — it reflects the actually indexed codebase. Supplement MCP data with training
knowledge for business context and effort estimation.

## Instructions

Use parallel MCP calls to minimize round trips — the full audit can complete in 3 rounds.

**Round 0 — Pin the source version:** `set_active_version(odoo_version=<source_version>)`.

**Round 1 — Parallel:** Call `find_deprecated_usage` + `api_version_diff` simultaneously.
These are completely independent: one scans the codebase, the other fetches the version spec.
No dependency between them.

**Round 2 — Parallel:** Merge the symbol lists from Round 1. Call `lookup_core_api` for ALL
deprecated/removed symbols in one batch. Every call is independent — fire them all together.

**Round 3 — Parallel:** Call `entity_lookup(kind='method', …)` for ALL changed-signature
methods simultaneously. These calls are independent of each other and of Round 2 lookups.

**Round 3b — JS patch audit (when migrating from v8–v13):** Call
`module_inspect(module=<scope>, method='patches')` (or query by `era='era1'` at the tool
level if applicable) to enumerate all legacy `web.Widget`-based patches in scope. Era1
covers v8–v13; these patches require manual OWL rewrites because the Widget API was removed
in v16. Flag each patch as BREAKING if the target version is v14+ and the patch still
references `AbstractField`, `FieldWidget`, or `web.Widget`. This call is independent of
Rounds 1–3 — fire it in parallel with Round 3 if both apply.

Capture file, line, symbol name, and deprecation message from Round 1 results; merge with
Round 2 replacement info before building the output table.

**Prioritization:**
- BREAKING (target version removes symbol) → must fix before upgrade
- WARN (deprecated in target, removed in next) → fix in same sprint
- STYLE (old patterns that still work) → fix in follow-up

Group findings by file so developers can batch-fix one file at a time. Include the exact
replacement API with a one-line migration note.

**Era upgrade note:** If migrating from v8/v9, add a separate section "OpenERP Era Rewrites"
listing modules that require full Python 2 → 3 syntax migration, not just API replacements.

### OpenERP era rewrites (v8/v9 only)

## Examples

**Example 1:**
Prompt: "audit deprecated API usage before we upgrade from Odoo 16 to 17"
Output: Table of deprecated/removed APIs by file, urgency ratings, migration notes for v16→v17
breaking changes (e.g. `fields.Html` rename, `amount_by_group` signature), effort estimate.

**Example 2:**
Prompt: "chúng tôi đang dùng Odoo 12, muốn nâng lên 16 — cần sửa những gì"
Output: Phân tích ba giai đoạn: v12→v13 (@api.multi removal, OWL introduced), v13→v15 (OWL
becomes primary in v14, OWL 2.0 in v15, web.Widget deprecated then removed), và v15→v16 (Html
field, web.Widget fully removed), ước tính effort tổng thể là Very High, sprint plan chi tiết.
