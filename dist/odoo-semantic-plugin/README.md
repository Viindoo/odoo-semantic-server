# Odoo Semantic Plugin for Claude Code

A Claude Code plugin that brings Odoo codebase intelligence into your AI coding workflow. Adds 15 persona-specific skills, 2 orchestration agents, and a setup command powered by the Odoo Semantic MCP server.

## Quick install (3 steps — all required)

Inside Claude Code, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add Viindoo/claude-plugins   # one-time, if not already registered
/plugin install odoo-semantic@viindoo-plugins
/odoo-semantic:setup
```

> ⚠️ **`/odoo-semantic:setup` is mandatory on Claude Code v2.1.x.** Plugin manifests use a
> `userConfig` block to collect the API key + MCP URL, but the CLI currently
> does not prompt for those values at install time
> ([anthropics/claude-code#39455](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/39455),
> [#39827](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/39827)). Without it
> the plugin loads its skills but the MCP server silently fails — `claude mcp list`
> will not show `odoo-semantic`.
>
> ⚠️ **Restart Claude Code after `/odoo-semantic:setup`** to actually load the
> MCP tools. Claude Code v2.x does not hot-reload MCP servers within a session
> ([#46426](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/46426) — "not
> planned"). The setup command verifies the server via `curl` and tells you
> when to restart.

## Setup command

```
/odoo-semantic:setup
```

Interactive setup that:
1. Prompts for your MCP server URL and API key
2. Validates key format (`osm_...`)
3. Registers the MCP server via `claude mcp add --scope user`
4. Probes `/health` + `/mcp` with `curl` to verify server + key
5. Tells you to restart Claude Code (required to load MCP tools)

## Requirements

- **Odoo Semantic MCP server URL** — `https://odoo-semantic.viindoo.com:9999/mcp` (provided by your admin)
- **API key** — format `osm_<alphanumeric>`, obtain from your server admin or via the `/install/` endpoint
- Claude Code with MCP support (tested on v2.1.140)

## For server admins — issuing API keys

Run on the server (not the client):

```bash
~/.venv/odoo-semantic-mcp/bin/python -m src.manager create-api-key <name>
```

The raw key prints once (`osm_…`). Distribute over a secure channel.

## For contributors — local dev install

Test changes from a checkout without going through the marketplace:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./dist/odoo-semantic-plugin/
```
